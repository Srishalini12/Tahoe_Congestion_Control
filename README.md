# Tahoe_Congestion_Control
Simulation of TCP Congestion Window increase of Tahoe using socket programming in C

**TCP Tahoe:**
> TCP Tahoe, a congestion control algorithm, plays a pivotal role in maintaining network stability and performance.
> The algorithm encompasses two primary phases: slow start and congestion avoidance.
> During slow start, the congestion window size begins modestly and experiences exponential growth for each received acknowledgment.
> Subsequently, the congestion avoidance phase ensues, characterized by a linear increase in the congestion window.
